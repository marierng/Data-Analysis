**Conceptual Plan for Analyzing Municipality Complaint Texts using NLP Techniques**

**1. Data Selection and Structure**
The goal of this project is the use of NLP techniques on a dataset that resembles municipality complaints. A suitable dataset is found on Kaggle. The dataset should include customer complaints, product reviews or online comments. These types of datasets typically contain unstructured textual data. The chosen dataset should include columns such as id, date, and the complaint content / review.

**2. Data Preprocessing**
First, preprocessing is done to convert raw textual data into clean and analysable formats. Preprocessing steps:
*	Text Cleaning: Removing punctuation, numbers, and special characters
*	Lowercasing: text gets converted into lowercase 
*	Stopwords Removal: Eliminating stopwords (e.g., "and," "the," "is"); (not useful for meaning)
*	Tokenization: Splitting texts into individual tokens
*	Lemmatization/Stemming: Reducing words to their base form

**3. Vectorization of Text Data**
The next step includes the analysis of the text data numerically. Therefore, it must be converted into numerical vectors. Two common methods are:
*	Bag of Words (BoW): This approach converts text into fixed-length vectors based on word frequency. It doesnÂ´t pay attention to grammar and word order.
*	Bigram: A bigram is a pair of consecutive words or tokens in a sequence, commonly used in natural language processing to analyze text patterns

**4. Topic Extraction Techniques**
Now, the third step is to identify the most important in the complaints. Following methods are used:
*	Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): A generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups, useful for discovering abstract topics within texts.
*	Bert: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers is a pre-trained deep learning model developed by Google. It is designed to understand the context of words in a sentence. For this it considers the entire sentence at once rather than in a sequential manner. This model is based on the Transformer architecture. It has achieved state-of-the-art results in NLP tasks such as question answering, language inference, and sentiment analysis. BERT is bidirectional, which means that it captures the context of a word from its preceding and following words.

**5. Python Libraries**
The implementation will use several Python libraries:
*	NLTK and spaCy for text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopwords removal, lemmatization).
*	scikit-learn for vectorization (BoW, TF-IDF) and machine learning tasks.
*	gensim for topic modeling using LDA.
*	pandas and numpy for data handling and numerical operations.
